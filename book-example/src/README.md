# mdBook

**mdBook** is a command line tool and Rust crate to create books using Markdown files. It's very similar to Gitbook but written in [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org).

What you are reading serves as an example of the output of mdBook and at the same time as a high-level documentation.

mdBook is free and open source, you can find the source code on [Github](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook). Issues and feature requests can be posted on the [Github Issue tracker](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook/issues).

## API docs

Alongside this book you can also read the [API docs](https://docs.rs/mdbook/*/mdbook/) generated by Rustdoc if you would like to use mdBook as a crate or write a new renderer and need a more low-level overview.

## License

mdBook, all the source code, is released under the [Mozilla Public License v2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/)
