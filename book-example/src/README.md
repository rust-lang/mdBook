# mdBook

**mdBook** is a command line tool and Rust crate to create books using Markdown files. It's very similar to Gitbook but written in [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org).

What you are reading serves as an example of the output of mdBook and at the same time as high-level docs.

mdBook is free and open source, you can find the source code on [Github](https://github.com/azerupi/mdBook). Issues and feature requests can be posted on the [Github Issue tracker](https://github.com/azerupi/mdBook/issues).

## API docs

Alongside this book you can also read the [API docs](mdbook/index.html) generated by Rustdoc if you would like
to use mdBook as a crate or write a new renderer and need a more low-level overview.
