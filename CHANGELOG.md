## mdBook 0.4.24
[eb77083...8767ebf](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/compare/eb77083...8767ebf)

### Fixed
- The precompiled linux-gnu mdbook binary available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases) inadvertently switched to a newer version of glibc. This release goes back to an older version that should be more compatible on older versions of Linux.

## mdBook 0.4.8
[fcceee4...b592b10](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/compare/fcceee4...b592b10)

### Changed
- The chapter name is now included in the search breadcrumbs.
  [#1389](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1389)
- Pressing Escape will remove the `?highlight` argument from the URL.
  [#1427](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1427)
- `mdbook init --theme` will now place the theme in the root of the book
  directory instead of in the `src` directory.
  [#1432](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1432)
- A custom renderer that sets the `command` to a relative path now interprets
  the relative path relative to the book root. Previously it was inconsistent
  based on the platform (either relative to the current directory, or relative
  to the renderer output directory). Paths relative to the output directory
  are still supported with a deprecation warning.
  [#1418](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1418)
- The `theme` directory in the config is now interpreted as relative to the
  book root, instead of the current directory.
  [#1405](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1405)
- Handle UTF-8 BOM for chapter sources.
  [#1285](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1285)

- Properly handle `<` and `>` characters in the table of contents.
  [#1376](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1376)
- Fixed to properly serialize the `build` table in the config, which prevented
  setting it in the API.
  [#1378](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1378)

## mdBook 0.4.5
[eaa6914...f66df09](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/compare/eaa6914...f66df09)

  documentation.
  [#1345](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1345)

### Fixed
- Now supports symbolic links for files in the `src` directory.
  [#1323](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1323)

## mdBook 0.4.3
[9278b83...4df9ec9](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/compare/9278b83...4df9ec9)

### Added
- Added `output.html.cname` option to emit a `CNAME` file which is used by
  GitHub Pages to know which domain is being used.
  [#1311](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1311)

### Changed
- `mdbook test` no longer stops on the first test failure, but instead will
  run all the tests.
  [#1313](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1313)
- Removed the `local` font source for Source Code Pro, as the locally
  installed font may not render properly on FireFox on macOS.
  [#1307](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1307)

### Fixed
- Added newline to end of `.nojekyll` file.
  [#1310](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1310)

  [#1281](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1281)
- Updated highlight.js. This adds several languages: c, c-like (effectively
  cpp), csharp (replaces cs), kotlin, less, lua, php-template, plaintext,
  python-repl, r, scss, typescript.
  [#1277](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1277)

### Fixed
- Fixed SUMMARY links that contained newlines.

- Fixed SUMMARY links that contain `%20` spaces.
  [#1293](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1293)
- Fixed favicon so that if only the png or svg is overridden, the other is not
  automatically included in the `<link>` tag.
  [#1272](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1272)

## mdBook 0.4.1
[d4df7e7...649f355](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/compare/d4df7e7...649f355)

### Changed

## mdBook 0.4.0
[99ecd4f...d4df7e7](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/compare/99ecd4f...d4df7e7)

### Breaking Changes
- Several of the changes in the release have altered the public API of the
  mdbook library.
- Many dependencies have been updated or replaced.
  This also removes the `--websocket-hostname` and `--websocket-port` from
  the `serve` command.
  [#1211](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1211)
- A new "404" page is now automatically rendered. This requires knowledge of
  the base URL of your site to work properly. If you decide to use this as
  your 404 page, you should set the `site-url` setting in the book
  configuration so mdbook can generate the links correctly. Alternatively you
  can disable the 404 page generation, or set up your own 404 handling in your
  web server.
  [#1221](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1221)
- The `debug` and `output` features have been removed as they were unused.
  [#1211](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1211)
- If you are using customized themes, you may want to consider setting the
  `preferred-dark-theme` config setting, as it now defaults to "navy".
  [#1199](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1199)
- "Playpen" has been renamed to "playground". This is generally backwards
  compatible for users, but `{{#playpen}}` will now display warnings. This may
  impact books that have modified the "playpen" elements in the theme.
  [#1241](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1241)
- If a renderer is not installed, it is now treated as an error. If you want
  the old behavior of ignoring missing renderers, set the `optional` setting
  for that renderer.
  [#1122](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1122)
- If you have a custom favicon, you may need to look into adding an SVG
  version, otherwise the default SVG icon will be displayed.
  [#1230](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1230)

### Added
- Added a new `[rust]` configuration section to `book.toml`, which allows
  setting the default edition with `edition = "2018"`.
  [#1163](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1163)
- Renderers can now be marked as `optional`, so that they will be ignored if
  the renderer is not installed.
  [#1122](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1122)
- Added `head.hbs` to allow adding content to the `<head>` section in HTML.
  [#1206](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1206)
- Added "draft chapters". These are chapters listed without a link to indicate
  content yet to be written.
  [#1153](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1153)
- Added "parts" to split a book into different sections. Headers can be added
  to `SUMMARY.md` to signify different sections.
  [#1171](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1171)
- Added generation of a "404" page for handling missing pages and broken links.
  [#1221](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1221)
- Added configuration section for specifying URL redirects.
  [#1237](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1237)
- Added an SVG favicon that works with light and dark colors schemes.
  [#1230](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1230)

### Changed
- Changed default Rust attribute of `allow(unused_variables)` to `allow(unused)`.
  [#1195](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1195)
- Fonts are now served locally instead of from the Google Fonts CDN. The
  `copy-fonts` option was added to disable this if you want to supply your own
  fonts.
  [#1188](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1188)
- Switched the built-in webserver for the `serve` command to a new
  implementation. This results in some internal differences in how websockets
  are handled, which removes the separate websocket options. This should also
  make it easier to serve multiple books at once.
  [#1211](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1211)
- The default dark theme is now "navy".
  [#1199](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1199)

  to your preferred dark theme.
  [#1037](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1037)
- Added `rustdoc_include` preprocessor. This makes it easier to include
  portions of an external Rust source file. The rest of the file is hidden,

  async/await to Rust highlighting).
  [#1041](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1041)
- Raised minimum supported rust version to 1.35.
  [#1003](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1003)
- Hidden code lines are no longer dynamically removed via JavaScript, but
  instead managed with CSS.
  [#846](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/846)
  [#1065](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1065)

  and some rendering issues.
  [#1058](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1058)
- Fix header auto-hide on browsers with momentum scrolling that allows
  negative `scrollTop`.
  [#1070](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1070)

  Julia support.
  [#942](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/942)

## mdBook 0.2.3 (2018-01-18)
[2c20c99...6cbc41d](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/compare/2c20c99...6cbc41d)

### Added
- Added an optional button to the top of the page which will link to a git

## mdBook 0.2.2 (2018-10-19)
[7e2e095...2c20c99](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/compare/7e2e095...2c20c99)

### Added
- 🎉 Process-based custom preprocessors. See [the
  docs](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/for_developers/preprocessors.html)
  for more.
  [#792](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/792)

- 🎉 Configurable preprocessors.

  Added `build.use-default-preprocessors` boolean TOML key to allow disabling
  the built-in `links` and `index` preprocessors.

  Added `[preprocessor]` TOML tables to configure each preprocessor.

  Specifying `[preprocessor.links]` or `[preprocessor.index]` will enable the
  respective built-in preprocessor if `build.use-default-preprocessors` is
  `false`.

  Added `fn supports_renderer(&self, renderer: &str) -> bool` to the
  `Preprocessor` trait to specify if the preprocessor supports the given
  renderer. The default implementation always returns `true`.

  `Preprocessor::run` now takes a book by value instead of a mutable
  reference. It should return a `Book` value with the intended modifications.

  Added `PreprocessorContext::renderer` to indicate the renderer being used.

  [#658](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/658)
  [#787](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/787)

## mdBook 0.2.1 (2018-08-22)
[91ffca1...7e2e095](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/compare/91ffca1...7e2e095)

  [#761](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/761)

### Fixed
- Fix table colors, broken by Stylus -> CSS transition
  [#765](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/765)

## mdBook 0.2.0 (2018-08-02)

### Changed
- 💥 This release changes how links are handled in mdBook. Previously, relative
  links were interpreted relative to the book's root. In `0.2.0`+ links are
  relative to the page they are in, and use the `.md` extension. This has [several
  advantages](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/603#issue-166701447),
  such as making links work in other markdown viewers like GitHub. You will
  likely have to change links in your book to accommodate this change. For
  example, a book with this layout:

  ```
  chapter_1/
      section_1.md
      section_2.md
  SUMMARY.md
  ```

  Previously a link in `section_1.md` to `section_2.md` would look like this:
  ```markdown
  [section_2](chapter_1/section_2.html)
  ```

  Now it must be changed to this:
  ```markdown
  [section_2](section_2.md)
  ```

- 💥 `mdbook test --library-path` now accepts a comma-delimited list of
  arguments rather than taking all following arguments. This makes it easier
  to handle the trailing book directory argument without always needing to put
  ` -- ` before it. Multiple instances of the option continue to be accepted:
  `mdbook test -L foo -L bar`.

- 💥 `mdbook serve` has some of its options renamed for clarity. See `mdbook
  help serve` for details.

- Embedded rust playpens now use the "stable" playground API.
  [#754](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/754)

### Fixed
- Escaped includes (`\{{#include file.rs}}`) will now render correctly.
  [f30ce01](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/commit/f30ce0184d71e342141145472bf816419d30a2c5)
- `index.html` will now render correctly when the book's first section is
  inside a subdirectory.
  [#756](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/756)
