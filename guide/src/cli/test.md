# The test command

When writing a book, you may want to provide some code samples,
and it's important that these be kept accurate as your software API evolves.
For example,
[The Rust Programming Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) uses a lot
of code samples that could become outdated as the language evolves.

MdBook supports a `test` command which runs code samples in your book as doc tests to verify they
will compile, and, optionally, run correctly.
For details on how to specify the test to be done and outcome to be expected, see [Code Blocks](/format/mdbook.md#code-blocks).

At the moment, mdBook only supports doc *tests* written in Rust, although code samples can be written and *displayed* in many programming languages.

#### Specify a directory

The `test` command can take a directory as an argument to use as the book's root
instead of the current working directory.

```bash
mdbook test path/to/book
```

#### `--dest-dir`

The `--dest-dir` (`-d`) option allows you to change the output directory for the
book. Relative paths are interpreted relative to the book's root directory. If
not specified it will default to the value of the `build.build-dir` key in
`book.toml`, or to `./book`.

#### `--chapter`

The `--chapter` (`-c`) option allows you to test a specific chapter of the
book using the chapter name or the relative path to the chapter.

#### `--library-path` `[`deprecated`]`

***Note*** This argument is deprecated.  Since Rust edition 2018, the compiler needs an explicit `--extern` argument for each external crate used in a  doc test, it no longer simply scans the library path for likely-looking crates.  
New projects should list external crates as dependencies in a **Cargo.toml** file and reference that file in your ***book.toml***, as described in [rust configuration](/format/configuration/general.html#rust-options).

The `--library-path` (`-L`) option allows you to add directories to the library
search path used by `rustdoc` when it builds and tests the examples. Multiple
directories can be specified with multiple options (`-L foo -L bar`) or with a
comma-delimited list (`-L foo,bar`). The path should point to the Cargo
[build cache](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/build-cache.html) `deps` directory that
contains the build output of your project. For example, if your Rust project's book is in a directory
named `my-book`, the following command would include the crate's dependencies when running `test`:

```shell
mdbook test my-book -L target/debug/deps/
```

See the `rustdoc` command-line [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/command-line-arguments.html#-l--library-path-where-to-look-for-dependencies)
for more information.
