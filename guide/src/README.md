# mdBook

**mdBook** is a command line tool and Rust crate to create books using Markdown
(as by the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) specification) files. It's very
similar to Gitbook but written in [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org).

What you are reading serves as an example of the output of mdBook and at the
same time as a high-level documentation.

mdBook is free and open source, you can find the source code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). Issues and feature
requests can be posted on the [GitHub issue
tracker](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues).

## API docs

Alongside this book you can also read the [API
docs](https://docs.rs/mdbook/*/mdbook/) generated by Rustdoc if you would like
to use mdBook as a crate or write a new renderer and need a more low-level
overview.

## License

mdBook, all the source code, is released under the [Mozilla Public License
v2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/).
