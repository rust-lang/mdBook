# A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale

They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with
draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all
dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation
about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find
herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.
Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,
and would only say, "I am older than you, and must know better;" and this Alice
would not allow, without knowing how old it was, and as the Lory positively
refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.
