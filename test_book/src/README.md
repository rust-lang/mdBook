# Demo Book

This is a simple demo book, which is intended to be used for verifying and validating style changes in mdBook.
This contains dummy examples of various markdown elements and code languages, so that one can check changes made in mdBook styles.

This rough outline is :

- individual : contains basic markdown elements such as headings, paragraphs, links etc.
- languages : contains a `hello world` in each of supported language to see changes in syntax highlighting
- rust : contains language examples specific to rust, such as play pen, runnable examples etc.

This is more for checking and fixing style, rather than verifying that correct code is generated for given markdown, that is better handled in tests.
